# Legacy System Migration - Spring Boot Project

## Scenario
We are migrating a legacy Spring Boot application to the latest Spring Boot version while:
- Maintaining backward compatibility for existing clients.
- Minimizing downtime during the migration.
- Gradually rolling out changes using feature flags.

## Requirements
1. **Update Configuration & Remove Deprecated API Usage**
    - Migrate `application.properties` to `application.yml` where appropriate.
    - Replace all deprecated Spring Boot APIs and annotations with their recommended alternatives.
    - Update any old configuration classes to use the latest Spring Boot conventions.

2. **Handle Breaking Changes in Third-party Libraries**
    - Identify libraries with major version changes and adjust code accordingly.
    - Add compatibility layers/adapters where breaking changes occur.
    - Keep a changelog of updated dependencies.

3. **Implement Feature Flags for Gradual Migration**
    - Integrate a feature flag mechanism (e.g., `Togglz` or `FF4j`) to enable/disable new features without redeploy.
    - Configure feature flags to be externally manageable (YAML, DB, or REST).

4. **Deployment & Downtime Minimization**
    - Enable zero-downtime deployment configurations (e.g., blue-green or rolling deployments).
    - Provide a fallback path if new APIs fail.
    - Maintain old endpoints with a deprecation warning until migration is complete.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use **Spring Boot 3.x** with Java 17+.
- Include dependencies:
    - Spring Web
    - Spring Data JPA
    - Spring Boot Actuator
    - Togglz or FF4j (for feature flags)
    - H2 Database (demo)
    - Validation
- Package structure:
  com.example.legacymigration
  ├── controller
  ├── service
  ├── repository
  ├── config
  ├── featureflags
  ├── compatibility
  └── model
- Follow clean code best practices.
- Include JUnit tests for backward compatibility and feature flag behavior.

## Deliverables
- Fully working Spring Boot project with:
- Updated configs and APIs to latest standards.
- Feature flag-based rollout.
- Compatibility adapters for breaking changes.
- Monitoring endpoints via Actuator.
